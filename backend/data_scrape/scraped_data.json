Various aspects of MATLAB programming for numerical computation will be covered in these modules, with each module dedicated to an equivalent numerical topic. There will be self-study problems and graded assignment problems given each week, which are to be solved using MATLAB. The course plan is:\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to MATLAB Programming:\n\n  This module will introduce the students to MATLAB programming through a few examples. Students who have used MATLAB are still recommended to do this module, as it introduces MATLAB in context of how we use it in this course\n\n\nBuilding your Code with MATLAB:\n\n  This module covers MATLAB Script and Function files, loops, execution control, best-practices for MATLAB functions and tips on how to debug a MATLAB code.\n\n\nApproximations and Errors:\n\n  Taylor\u2019s / Maclaurin series expansion of some functions will be used to introduce approximations and errors in computational methods\n\n\nLinear Equations:\u00a0\nThe focus of this module is to do a quick introduction of most popular numerical methods in linear algebra, and use of MATLAB to solve practical problems.\n\n\nNonlinear Equations:\u00a0\nAfter introduction to bisection rule, this module primarily covers Newton-Raphson method and MATLAB routines \nfzero\n and \nfsolve\n.\n\n\nNumerical Differentiation and Integration:\n\u00a0Methods of numerical differentiation and integration, trade-off between truncation and round-off errors, error propagation and MATLAB functions for integration will be discussed.\n\n\nOrdinary Differential Equations (ODE):\u00a0\nExplicit ODE solving techniques in single variable will be covered in this module.\n\n\nODE-IVP in Multiple Variables:\u00a0\nThis module will cover ODE solving in multiple variables, stiff systems, and practical problems. The importance of ODEs in engineering is reflected by the fact that two modules are dedicated to ODEs.\n\n\nRegression and Interpolation:\u00a0\nThe focus will be practical ways of using linear and nonlinear regression and interpolation functions in MATLAB.\n\n\nODE-BVP and DAE:\n\u00a0ODE-Boundary Value Problems; Differential Algebraic Equations\n\n\nPartial Differential Equations (PDEs):\n Practical ways of solving Hyperbolic and Parabolic PDEs\n\n\nBringing it all together:\n Optimization andSolving interesting computational problems by bringing together multiple concepts\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n Based on feedback from previous students, Final Exam will be based on the material covered in the first nine weeks of the course. Assignments will continue to be given in the last three weeks. This allows learners to \"digest\" the material and perform well in the exam.\n\n\nThis course was first introduced as an eight-week course in 2016. With feedback from students, this course was expanded to twelve-week (three credits) course in 2023. Some new aspects have been introduced and additional video lectures have been added to better explain some important concepts.\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the support from MathWorks, enrolled students have access to MATLAB for the duration of the course.",

    "noc25_ec07": "Week 1:\u00a0\n\u25cf Introduction: Introduce the course and the objective of the course. I will provide a broad overview of the course and landscape of the predictive models. In our experience, we see that predictive analytics is crucial in the industry and business and part of the daily life of a data scientist in the corporate sector.\n\u25cf Least Squares method: We introduce the concept of simple and multiple linear regression as regression hyper-plane. Then we discuss the concept of least square methods.\nWeek 2:\u00a0\n\u25cf Normal Equations: We discuss the results that the normal equations will always have at least one solution. If the system is of full rank, then the least square method will give us analytically solvable unique solutions. Also, we discuss why \"\"mean absolute deviation\"\" does not have an analytical solution.\n\u25cf Gauss Markov theorem:  Here, we introduce the underlying assumptions of linear regression models. We discuss how the Gauss-Markov theorem is developed under the assumptions of the homogeneity and independence of the residuals. We also discuss the concept of mean squared error (MSE). How the MSE and prediction accuracy are related?\nWeek 3:\u00a0\n\u25cf The geometry of Regression Model and Feature Engineering  Here, we discuss some examples. Also, we discuss the \"\"basis expansion\"\" in mathematical statistics, known as \"\"feature engineering\"\" in ML. With feature engineering, we put the original data into a higher dimension. We hope we find a good fit for a linear hyperplane in a higher dimension, explaining the non-linear relationship between the feature space and the target variable.\n\u25cf Statistical Inference of Regression Coefficient: Here, we discuss the sampling distribution of regression coefficients and statistical inference of regression coefficient. We discuss how the t-test can be conducted to test whether a predictor/feature has a statistically significant effect on the dependent or target variables.\nWeek 4:\u00a0\n\u25cf Checking Model Assumptions We discuss how to check the model assumptions like (1) Independence, (2) Homogeneity or (3) Normality using statistical tests. We discuss how Bartlet's rank test can be used to check randomness in residuals. How can we apply the Breusch-Pagan Test to check homogeneity? Then we discuss how the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test can be used to check the normality!\n\u25cf Model Comparison with R-squared, RMSE, AIC or BIC  We discuss, how we compare two or several models using selection criteria, such as RMSE, R-squared, adjusted-R-Squared, AIC or BIC and select the best model among the set of possible models.\nWeek 5:\u00a0\n\u25cf Model Complexity and Bias-Variance tradeoff  In this part, we tried to understand the issues of model complexities. We discuss the concept of what we mean by a complex model. Sometimes complex models help us to achieve high prediction accuracy. However, we often achieve it as a cost of the interpretability of the model. We try to capture the model complexity concerning the concept of bias-variance tradeoff. Finally, we discuss how we can achieve a parsimonious model by minimising MSE.\n\u25cf Feature selection and Dimension Reduction Here, we discuss the stepwise feature selection or variable selection algorithms. We discuss how the feature selection technique can reduce the problem's dimension and achieve an interpretable and parsimonious regression model.\nWeek 6:\u00a0\n\u25cf Multicollinearity and Variance Inflation Factor Here, we discuss the problem of multicollinearity in the regression problem. We discuss how the correlation between strong or more features induces a strong correlation between the OLS estimators of coefficients. This makes the sampling distribution a very strong elliptical shape due to tight correlation. As a result, the standard error increases significantly, and the confidence interval becomes very large. We discuss how the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) can be used to measure the contribution of each feature towards the multicollinearity problem.\n\u25cf Regularization with LASSO, Ridge and Elastic Net In the second part of Lecture 6, we discuss what is \"\"Ill-posed problems\"\". We discuss how Tikhonov Regularization reconstructs the unconstrained minimization of the OLS method into constraint minimization. We discuss how the L2 penalty corresponds to the Ridge solution and the L1 penalty corresponds to LASSO solutions. We discuss why LASSO is a continuous subset selection and one should use LASSO feature selection over stepwise feature selection.\n\u25cf Ridge Regression with Python\nWeek 7:\u00a0\n\u25cf Regression Analysis with Python\n\u25cf Regression Analysis with R\n\u25cf Regression Analysis with Julia\nWeek 8:\u00a0\nMajor Applications of Regression Models\n\u25cf Capital Asset Pricing Model Here, we present a very celebrated application of the statistical regression model in quantitative finance, known as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The CAPM is often used to evaluate whether an asset is overpriced, underpriced, or fairly priced.\n\u25cf Bootstrap Regression Here, we discuss the concept of Bootstrap statistics and nonparametric bootstrap regression. We discuss the two algorithms of Bootstrap regression: (1) Residual Bootstrap Regression and (2) Paired Bootstrap Regression\n\u25cf Time Series Forecasting with Regression Model Here, we focus on how the regression model technique can be implemented for long-term and short-term forecasting. We develop a long-term forecasting model by modelling the trend and seasonality as a function of time. On the other hand, we develop the short-term forecasting model using the Auto-regressive model. We used the AirPassengers dataset.\n\u25cf Granger Causal model. Here, I introduce an excellent application of the regression model, the Granger Causal model. Correlation does not imply Causation. In practice establishing Causation from the data is very difficult. However, the Granger causal regression model tries to answer the question of causality with limited capability.\nWeek 9:\u00a0\n\u25cf Logistic Regression  In this video, we introduce the concept of logistic regression for binary class classification problems.\n\u25cf MLE of coefficient of Logistic Regression Here, we discuss how to estimate the regression coefficient of logistic regression.\nWeek 10:\u00a0\n\u25cf Fit Logistic Regression with optim function in R\n\u25cf Fit Logistic Regression with glm function in R\n\u25cf Fit Logistic Regression with sklearn in Python\n\u25cf Fit Logistic Regression in Julia\nWeek 11:\u00a0\n\u25cf Logistic Regression and Inference In this lecture, we discuss how we can make statistical inferences for the logistic regression model.\n\u25cf Discriminant Analysis In this lecture, we discuss the concept of discriminant analysis, LDA, and QDA.\nWeek 12:\u00a0\n\u25cf Multinomial Logit Regression\n\u25cf Generalised Linear Regression\n\u25cf Poisson Regression\n\u25cf Negative Binomial Regression",
